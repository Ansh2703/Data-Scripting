# Data-Scripting

Implemented a Python script using BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape data from a Wikipedia page on Big Tech in India. The script fetches and parses HTML content, extracts multiple tables (if available), the introductory summary, and an infobox if present. Data is formatted using tabulate for clarity. Enhanced skills in web scraping, data extraction, and parsing for structured presentation.
